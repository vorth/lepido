# Recovering Physical Data

Today, 2023-12-26, I spent 3-4 hours going over my old physical data, trying to determine which
data has yet to be digitized, and also to determine how the collection had been renumbered
over the years.  Here are my conclusions, captured as a rough chronology.

## 1975 and Earlier

The evidence suggests that Layne and I started picking up dead butterflies on the roadside
(then gravel) around 1972 or 1973.  Many of my oldest specimens are un-spread in the "trash"
drawer, dating from those days.  These are predominantly Celastrina argiolus and Colias
philodice / eurytheme.

The oldest data I seem to have recorded is on the "green sheets", the backs of voting applications
that Mom brought home from her time as an election judge at Harlem Center.  There are a couple
of Monarchs attributed to Summer, 1973.  For a few specimens, I recovered dates from Mom's calendars
at some point, corresponding to trips to the Ozarks (1974) and to North Carolina (1975).  There is a
loose sheet where those trips are recorded.

Note that the green sheets were not compiled until a few years later, probably 1977.

## 1976

There are a dozen or so pages from a 1956 planner where I captured data in the Summer of 1976,
apparently for the first time.  Specimens 140 and 141 were first recorded there as 96 and 97,
but the ink for those numbers clearly indicates that the number assignment happened later.
The page also has numbers 134 and 135 noted there in green marker, and those numbers match
the "output" from the green sheets, so they were added later.

It appears that I started my first numbering rather arbitrarily at 100, on July 11, 1976,
based on ink color.

That Summer we made a trip West, starting with an Independence Day celebration in Treynor.
The data for those specimens is recorded only on two check register sheets, it appears,
numbered starting at 10 rather than continuing from 114 where the other notebook left off.

I had 168 specimens at the end of 1976.

## 1977

By Summer 1977 I had gotten my act together.  I dutifully recorded everything in an old Wartburg
notebook of Dad's, from Physics 301 (Heat).  I seem to have rather arbitrarily started numbering at
201, perhaps because my poor numbering in 1976.

Again, the 1977 notebook does include some specimen numbers added in green marker, matching the green sheets.

The green sheets seem to represent my first attempt to consistently renumber the collection.
This appears to have happened in the winter of 1977-78.

I had 332 specimens at the end of 1977.

## 1978

The result of the green sheet renumbering must have been unsatisfactory in some way, because it appears I did the final renumbering
before the collecting season in 1978.  That renumbering is captured in the small Lutheran Mutual notebook
labeled "B".

I began recording data in a 5x8" spiral notebook, but I abandoned that
in favor of the stenographer's notebook in June 1978, apparently.

I had 458 specimens at the end of 1978.

All subsequent data is recorded in the steno notebook, or digitally.
